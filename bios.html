<p>My area of study is the unique border where society and technology touch.  While this largely puts me in the shoes of the a cultural and political historian, I focus primarily on technology’s role in those spheres.  At this stage of my study, I am measuring the impact television has had on society during the late 1950s and early 1960s.  My dissertation in particular will focus on the public’s reception of the civil rights movement television news coverage.  In addition to this research, I was a teaching assistant in the 2012-2013 school year, and am currently a research assistant for the Vietnam Archive Project, which is funded by the National Endowment of the Humanities.</p>

<p>While my research will hopefully serve to help us understand the various ways technology changes society, my research also helps me build a more interactive pedagogical style. My goal in the classroom is to help students engage in historical study with the same focus and scope as students engage in the physical world. To accomplish this successfully, I create my lectures to stimulate as many of the student senses as possible.  I not only present an engaging narrative, but also force students to experience the guiding influences that stemmed from and affected those events. Every stage of the classroom experience would be a learning opportunity that stimulates all segments of the student’s senses; I structure every test to give students feedback so that students are consistently adding material to their interpretive framework. My returned tests report personalized error structures for the student to work on in order to improve for the next test. My critical analysis rubric outlines generalized errors while giving the student direction on how to improve their argumentation skills.  In lectures, I utilize contemporary digital and physical media, historical and news documents, visual art, music, and televisual footage, to assist students in experiencing a visceral history then allotted to them through texts.</p>

<p>I have taught classes on Early American History, Late American History, Early American Intellectual and Cultural History, and The Francophone World.  I have also assisted in the following courses on Late World Civilizations, Integrated Studies in the Arts and Humanities focused on US and the World, and Integrated Social Studies course on Time, Space, and Change in Latin America.</p>

<p>My favorite recreational activity is playing board games.</p>
